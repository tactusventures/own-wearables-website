                <p>
                    Thanks for shopping at OWN. We appreciate the fact that you like to buy the cool stuff we
                    build. We also want to make sure you have a rewarding experience while you’re exploring,
                    evaluating, and purchasing our products, whenever you’re at the Own Online Store, or on
                    the phone with the Own Contact Centre. (To make it visually easier on both of us, we’ll refer
                    to these entities as the “Own Store” in this policy).
                </p>

                <p>
                    As with any shopping experience, there are terms and conditions that apply to transactions
                    at an Own Store. We’ll be as brief as our attorneys will allow. The main thing to remember is
                    that by placing an order or making a purchase at an Own Store, you agree to the terms set
                    forth below along with Own’s Privacy Policy (Opens in a new window) and Terms of
                    Use(Opens in a new window).

                <h2>Standard Return Policy</h2>

                <p>
                    We fundamentally believe you will be thrilled with the products
                    you purchase from the Own Store. That’s because we go out of our way to ensure that
                    they’re designed and built to be just what you need. We understand, however, that
                    sometimes a product may not be what you expected it to be. In that unlikely event, we
                    invite you to review the following terms related to returning a product.
                    For any undamaged product, simply return it with its included accessories and packaging
                    along with the original receipt (or gift receipt) within ………. days of the date you receive the
                    product, and we’ll exchange it or offer a refund based upon the original payment method. In
                    addition, please note the following
                </p>

                <p>
                    Products can be returned only in the country or region in which they were originally
                    purchased.
                    For returns to an Own Store for cash, cash equivalent, and check transactions over……., Own
                    will mail a refund check to you within. ……....... Business days
                    Opened software cannot be returned if it contained a seal with the software license on the
                    outside of the package and you could read the software license before opening its
                    packaging. As an exception, you may return Own-branded software if you do not agree to
                    the licensing terms; however, you may not retain or otherwise use any copies of returned
                    software.
                    Own provides security features to enable you to protect your product in case of loss or
                    theft. If these features have been activated and cannot be disabled by the person in
                    possession of the phone, Own may refuse the return or exchange.

                <p>Making unauthorized modifications to the software on a shoes violates the own software
                    license agreement. The common term for modifying an shoes is jail-breaking, with a
                    particular emphasis on the second part of that term. That’s why we strongly, almost
                    emphatically, recommend that you do not do so. Really. Should you be unable to use your

                    warranty</p>

                <h2>Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections</h2>

                <p>
                    Own reserves the right to change prices for products displayed at/on the Own Store at any
                    time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information
                    about pricing and sales tax is available on the Payment & Pricing page. In the event you have

                    order. Once we receive your Online or Call Centre order, we’ll provide you with an email
                    order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify Own’s
                    acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are
                    simply confirming that we received your order. The Own Store reserves the right at any time
                    after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. If Own cancels an

                    when you will receive the products you purchased from the Own Store. Since the actual
                    delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond Own’s control once it leaves
                    our facilities, Own cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you
                    to ensure a smooth delivery.

                    of loss of, or damage to, product(s) shall pass to you when you, or a person designated by
                    you, acquires physical possession of the product(s). Title in the product(s) shall pass to you
                    when the product(s) is picked up by the carrier from our warehouse. At this point, you will
                    receive the Shipment Notification Email. If there are any issues with delivery, please contact
                    Own to resolve.

                <h2>Product Availability and Limitations</h2>

                    order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we
                    cannot supply a product you ordered, Own will cancel the order and refund your purchase
